[1.0.1.2]
* Corrected Build Numbers, changed Publish location, etc.
* Fixed a bug in the Screen Saver "Preview Window" that would cause the preview to lag when checking for a Firewall.

[1.0.0.50]
* The version current on codeplex. CodePlex is an Open Source Developer Website @ http://www.codeplex.com/, I have elected to release the software code under the Microsoft Reciprocal License. Enjoy!

[1.0.0.43]
* Fixed crash on screen saver settings dialog exit, introduced in last build.
* Fixed issue where characters would sometimes load more than once.
* Eliminating start-up delay caused by PNRP. Really, I need a central peer host instead of using PNRP, which would fix Peer Network for win2k/Win2k3 users and un-patch XP users.. but lack a colo. Anyone interested?

[1.0.0.42]
* Performing proper shutdown of character info worker thread, should resolve the sql worker thread abort issue.

[1.0.0.41]
* Fixed full-screen mode for non-Vista users (verified with win2k3 x64)

[1.0.0.37]
* Fixed Death Knight Character Sheets.

* Added P2P sharing of Character Info, via WCF/PeerChannel/PNRP, with an option to disable the feature in the settings dialog. The feature is enabled by default, shared character info is not persisted locally.

[1.0.0.31]

[1.0.0.23]
* Displaying more details in item tooltips, including BoP-status and base stat bonuses. Needs clean-up, effects (Use:/Equip:) section, etc.

[1.0.0.22]
* Added "Character Info Mini Viewer" control, it is used for the Character List in the saver window. Slight visual artifacts, but functional.

[1.0.0.21]
* using SqlCe as a local cache for wowarmory data, and making it a prereq for install
