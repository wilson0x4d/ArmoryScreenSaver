History
---

[1.0.2]
* Fixed a Realm Name bug that would prevent character sheets from loading.
* Switched Target Platform to AnyCPU, since X64 machines were unable to load proper codecs for video playback.
* Republished.

[1.0.1]
* Reworked Image Icon Caching, since WPF's BitmapImage request caching appears non-persistent and short-lived.
* Added Error Reporting dialog, which will let users more easily copy error details to the clipboard, and also offers a feature to send the error report directly.
* Eliminated the delay some users are experiencing when exiting the screen saver. Peer Networking may still cause a short delay, I'll tweak the network timeouts soon.
* Enforcing a 15 second delay before loading any armory data during screen saver start-up, and also deferring Peer Network init. This will give users a chance to cancel out of the screen saver without having to wait for network delays.
* Corrected Build Numbers, changed Publish location, etc.
* Fixed a bug in the Screen Saver "Preview Window" that would cause the preview to lag when checking for a Firewall.

[1.0.0]
* The version current on codeplex. CodePlex is an Open Source Developer Website @ http://www.codeplex.com/, I have elected to release the software code under the Microsoft Reciprocal License. Enjoy!
* Fixed crash on screen saver settings dialog exit, introduced in last build.
* Fixed issue where characters would sometimes load more than once.
* Eliminating start-up delay caused by PNRP. Really, I need a central peer host instead of using PNRP, which would fix Peer Network for win2k/Win2k3 users and un-patch XP users.. but lack a colo. Anyone interested?
* Performing proper shutdown of character info worker thread, should resolve the sql worker thread abort issue.
* Fixed full-screen mode for non-Vista users (verified with win2k3 x64)
* Fixed Death Knight Character Sheets.
* Re-publishing with SameSite redist, to help resolve deployment issues for some people.
* Added P2P sharing of Character Info, via WCF/PeerChannel/PNRP, with an option to disable the feature in the settings dialog. The feature is enabled by default, shared character info is not persisted locally.
* Removed artificial delays from chracter info loader.
* Fixing crash on x64 machines.
* Misc changes to tooltips.
* Cache expiry is now 6 hours.
* Modified cache sdf path to "My Documents" as "wasscache.sdf"
* Correcting bug with SDF schema mismatch, ensuring SDF reallocation on version change (temporary solution until I can get schema broken out into versioned sql scripts.)
* Displaying more details in item tooltips, including BoP-status and base stat bonuses. Needs clean-up, effects (Use:/Equip:) section, etc.
* Added "Character Info Mini Viewer" control, it is used for the Character List in the saver window. Slight visual artifacts, but functional.
* using SqlCe as a local cache for wowarmory data, and making it a prereq for install
* enabling cache policy for item icons, seems janky, will only matter to users with intermittent internet access (laptops)
* Added changelog window.
* Added offline resource cache for when wowarmory is too busy.
* Decreased Refresh Rate of Armory Data.
* Fixed preview mode
* Fixed fullscreen glitches
* Added mute toggle for video playback
* Added BMP to supported image extensions
* Fixed fill mode on images
