[1.0.0.43]
* Fixed crash on screen saver settings dialog exit, introduced in last build.
* Fixed issue where characters would sometimes load more than once.
* Eliminating start-up delay caused by PNRP. Really, I need a central peer host instead of using PNRP, which would fix Peer Network for win2k/Win2k3 users and un-patch XP users.. but lack a colo. Anyone interested?

[1.0.0.42]
* Performing proper shutdown of character info worker thread, should resolve the sql worker thread abort issue.
